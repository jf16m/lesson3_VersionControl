            <p class="lead">A Version Control System, otherwise known as VCS, is a system that allows team members to effectively manage files for a project without 
            losing track of the changes made to a file, its previous versions, who last changed the file, when changes were made to a file, what was changed in the file, and
            what is new or different in the file. This allows people to work on the same files simultaneously without conflict. It also allows you to revert to an older
            version of the file if needed. And even if you arenâ€™t with a team, Version Control Systems will backup files to help you stay neat with file management. </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git is an example of a Distributed Version Control System, otherwise known as DVCS. A Distributed Version Control system allows for each 
            Computer to have a mirror of the Remote repository, just in case of any unexpected occurrences, such as a server crashes and loses all its file structure, a 
            backup is ready on any other local Repository. This also opens the opportunities to work with several different remote repositories for collaborating with 
            different groups to solve different problems, all within the same project. This is how DVCS defers from other types of VCS, because of the versatility it provides 
            in file access, structure, and management.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">The main proponent of file management for this class is going to be utilized through Git. It is a free and open source distributed version 
            control system that handles everything from small to huge projects. It includes staging areas, and multiple workflows. The advantages of using Git is that
            everything is local, so you can work offline. Each user has a complete copy of the repository data stared locally on their personal machine. The processes run 
            much faster, and it will prevent mistakes like overwriting files on a shared repository from happening. Three basic steps to Git use include: Add, commit, and push.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">There is a major difference between a local repository, and a remote repository, however when it comes to GitHub, the local repository
            has all the same functions as a remote repository (which is a benefit). The difference between a local and remote repository is that a local repository
            is on the machine of somebody editing files from a remote repository. The remote repository as opposed to the local, is where all the finished projects
            from multiple users will go logged and ready for people to see, edit, or change. The local repository is where you will have files from the remote repository 
            ready for to be worked on, and when you connect to the remote repository you can then commit files.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">The creation of Git started on what we know today as Linux, which is a different Operating System than MAC OS x or Windows. The Linux Kernel 
            was an open source software project that began using a proprietary DVCS called BitKeeper, in 2002. The relationship between the developers of Linux Kernal and
            company that developed BitKeeper broke down, which prompted the Linux development community to develop a new system DVCS that was fast, had a simple design,
            fully distributed, and able to handle large projects like the Linux Kernel. As of today, Git is the most popularly used DVCS in the professional workforce.</p>
